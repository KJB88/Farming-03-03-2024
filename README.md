# Farming (A Game in a Day) 03-03-2024
Theme: Farming 02/03/2024 (a Game a Day Challenge). Time spent: 7.5hours

CONTROLS: Pick up/drop seeds with space bar, WASD to move. 

CONCEPT: Rapid seed growing balanced with withering plants encouraged fast gameplay to maintain pace and maximise score. Time trial for farming, basically.

IMPL: I got the bare framework in. I noticed there was a severe need for a HFSM system after I had handled the Growable FSM. Unfortunately, it was too late to re-design at that point, so the handy boolean nightmare showed up.

LESSONS: Scope further down. The concept seems simple but it needs to be simpler. These are simply too big for ~8 hours. Try to identify pattern requirements in a quick design rather than late in the day.
